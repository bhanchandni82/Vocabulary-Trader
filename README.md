This is a minimalist, high-performance vocabulary training app designed to turn standard 11+ curriculum drills into a high-stakes gaming mission. Born out of pure frustration of monther trying to get her daughter to practice for her Exams.
Built with a "Neo-Brutalist" aesthetic, it motivates students to master complex words by earning real-time digital rewards.

🎮 The Mission
Students must navigate through 24 levels of vocabulary challenges:

12 Synonyms: Analyzing assets with similar meanings.

12 Antonyms: Identifying opposites to secure the ledger.

The Payday: Every correct answer adds £0.08 to the live wallet.

The Intel: Incorrect answers trigger a "System Override" briefing, forcing the student to study the definition before resuming.

Bonus Round: Missed words aren't lost forever. Students can "Re-Trade" failed assets at the end of the session to recover 50% of the missed cash.

⚡ Technical Features
Zero Dependencies: 100% Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

Synthesized Audio: Uses the Web Audio API to generate "Cha-ching" and "Bloop" sound effects in real-time—no external MP3 files required.

Cinematic UI: Features a typewriter-style mission briefing with a blinking terminal cursor for an immersive "Hacker/FBI" vibe.

Mobile Optimized: Fully responsive design tailored for iPhone, iPad, and Android tablets with zero scrolling required.
